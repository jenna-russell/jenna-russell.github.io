<i><b> Still working on this <i><b>

An in-depth post on my experience deciding to do my PhD and the application process. I currently just accepted my offer yesterday, so I decided to write this while everything was still fresh on my mind. I write both about my personal experience and advice for future applicants.

<h2> Deciding to Apply (March 2023) </h2>

 I was working full-time, almost 2 years out of college when I decided something needed to change. I loved my job and the research I was doing at the bank, but the amount of red tape for doing my job was increasing drastically (thanks ChatGPT). I wanted to be in an environment that allowed me more freedom and flexibility, as well as focus only on research. When I started really thinking about the career I wanted, it became more and more clear that I needed a PhD. However, I had never worked in an academic research lab and didn't think I could actually get into a program. I sat down with my mentor from undergrad and told him I thought I should go get my masters first. He pushed me to do the PhD applications instead, reminding me that 3 years of full-time research and my patent outputs were quite a valuable experience. I want to thank [David Mimno][mimno] for his advice and confidence - I wouldn't have gotten into a PhD without his guidance.  

 I think this is a very personal decision and you truly have to be ready to spend 5 years doing research. My advice would be to think about what you want to do in the long-run and work backwords. What steps do you need to take now to get to that point? Obviously, people like the research they are doing but its still work. I don't believe the people who say you should only do a PhD if you are so passionate you couldn't think about ever not doing it! I think its better to ask, can I commit to the oppurtunity cost of graduate school? I have worked for 3 years and I think there are a lot of upsides of working first. I feel more commited in my decision, I know I'm not just doing it because it's the next logical step in my education. I am in a much better financial position than most my peers will be, since I have money sitting in retirement and investment funds that can grow over the next 5 years! For reference, money invested at a young age is worth the most. If you maxed out your Roth IRA at 22, that $7000 would turn into about $96,000 by the time you retire. If you start at 28, it will only be worth $67,000. At 30, it's only worth $60,000. So, building a bit of a nest egg, paying off any student debt, and getting a retirement account started may be very worth it in the long run and not something people often talk about. 

<h2> Pre-Application Research (April - July 2023) </h2> 

I decided I wanted to get my PhD in March of 2023, right around the time the previous cycle's admits were coming out. While I was sad I had missed that cycle, this turned out to be one of the best advantages I had. I knew I had about a year to research programs, do my applications, prep for interviews and learn how to choose which program was right for me. This mostly consited of identifying programs and faculty, reading as many papers as I could, and cold emailing people.

<b> Identifying Programs: </b>

The first step I took to decide where to apply was to think geographically. Currently, I am in Dallas, Texas but my close family is in the upstate NY area. Being closer to them was really important to me. I created a rule that programs I applied to had to be either (ideally both) less than a 6-hour drive or a direct flight to Rochester (exceptions were made for Stanford and UW). This left mostly schools in the Northeast and mid-atlantic. I also know that the price of applying is important to people. Kaiser Sun has created a great resource for which schools have fee waivers & who is eligible. I was able to get fee waivers for more than half the programs I applied to, which allowed me to apply more broadly without going over budget. I also did use csrankings and open rankings to generally get a feel for how much NLP research was happening and the general reputations of universities. If a school met these general criteria, I moved on to looking at the schools specific labs.

<b> Identifying Faculty: </b>
For me to apply to a school, I wanted there to be at least 2 professors who I would be happy to work with. This is because there are a lot of things that happen in life that we can't expect. Maybe your first choice isn't hiring that year, or you commit to a lab and then it doesn't work out with the original PI. You want to have a backup! There are a couple things that wereare most helpful. The first is getting an understanding of which professors work at what universities and what they work on. CSRankings is particularly good for this, as it links professors websites, google scholar progiles, and more. Be careful to note CS Rankings sometimes misidentifies people so the lists may not be the most updated or correct. Find out who the key figures in the subtopic you want to work on are. I spent a lot of time looking at papers I liked, and then going to look at those authors labs. You can look at who they typically collaborate with as well! Also, remember to look at program's pages for different research groups and the most updated faculty lists.

<b> Reading Papers: </b> 
This is the most important time to read as much research as possible. Before you start your SOP or applications, before you have to do interviews, before you need to even know exactly what you want to do. Get as well versed with the main papers in your subfield as well as new research to be up-to-date. When I say you will thank me, you will thank me! I know that you may already by reading a lot of papers for your current job or degree, but ramp it up. Double whatever you are currently doing. This will help you not only identify who the important people and instituations are, but also will make your applications and interviews go much more smoothly. I recommend doing this from May until September (then you need to pivot to applications).

<b> Cold Emailing: </b> 
Tread carefully here. All in all, I think it is helpful to email professors, but it has to be done correctly. If you are not very confident in your interpersonal skills or English proficiency, you may be better of not emailing. Of my 6 acceptances, I had emailed 2 of the professors. If you decide you would like to, here is what I did: 

1. Check professors site to ensure they do not have a 'no emails' policy. Do not email someone who has this. It will just piss them off. Some professors also have specific instructions, like a key word or form they would like you to fill out. Follow all instructions!

2. Read one of their recent papers and generate a few questions. You want to find a paper from the last year or two because you want to talk about a project the Professor is still interested in! You want to do this to include later on in your email - it isn't necessary, but I think doing so will get you much higher response rates.

3. Draft the email. I made a template that I changed for each professor. Google docs has an [email template][googlemail], so I drafted emails there and saved them in a folder. This was super helpful when I was doing applications later on because I had already verbalized why I wanted to work with a professor and could just reference that later on. My general format was an intro about myself, a paragraph about our research match, and a conclusion with a personal connection. You want to show them, briefly, why they should want to work with you. That means 2 things: you do cool research and you are a cool person. People often forget the human aspect! One of my potential advisors said my email was the only one he got that he knew wasn't written by chatgpt because I mentioned his french toast. End the email with something you have in common - maybe a shared alma matter, hobby, or just pay them a compliment. 

Example Email:


<blockquote> Dear Professor _______, <br><br>

My name is Jenna Russell, I’m a 2021 Cornell graduate and I’ve been a research data scientist at Bank of America (BofA)  in Plano, TX since leaving school, working on our virtual assistant Erica. I’ve realized how much I love the research aspect of my job and am applying to PhD programs for Fall 2024. <br><br>

At BofA, my research has centered around projects such as improving Erica intent predictions and translating Spanish to English. We also do a lot of work improving the experience for customer service agents. This year I’ve primarily researched creating dialogue summarization systems and creating a retrieval-augmented QA system for agents to use. I really enjoyed reading [paper name] earlier this year. I liked how [something you liked]. [Question about paper] ? <br><br>

I believe you would be a great advisor due to our mutual interest in [mutual interest]. I also really liked your food pictures on your website, it looks like you make a mean french toast. <br><br>

Best,<br>
Jenna Russell
