Welcome! I'm Jenna, a first-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I am advised by [Professor Mohit Iyyer](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~miyyer/). Prior to UMD, I spent a semester as a PhD student at University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I was also advised by Professor Iyyer. My current research interests include automatic text detection, understanding the differences in lexical patterns between LLM-generated and human-written text, and how humans can reliably use LLM generated texts. 

Prior to joining UMass, I was a data scientist for Bank of America, doing applied research for [Erica Conversational AI](https://promotions.bankofamerica.com/digitalbanking/mobilebanking/erica). I completed my B.S. at Cornell University, majoring in Statistics and Information Science, and grew up in nearby Rochester, New York.


Outside of my PhD, I spend my time lifting, running, and reading. I fit in somewhere between 70-100 books a year, mostly through audiobooks. Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39680770-jenna-russell), which I update pretty much daily. I also have a 13-year old cat named [Boo](blog/2025/cat).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
