## Work Experience

<b> Data Scientist, Bank of America, Erica Conversational AI Research & Development </b>\
Plano, TX, July 2021 - Present\
Created Semantic Role Labeling system specific to Conversational AI to improve the contextual understanding of chatbots\
Improved generative dialogue summarization model for call centers by creating a summarization dataset focused specifically on task-driven dialogue summaries for customer service and invented a hybrid extractive-abstractive modeling technique for real-time summarization\
Improved machine-translation system using weakly supervised methods of data generation for Spanish for Erica solution

<b> Global Technology Summer Analyst, Bank of America </b> \
Remote, May 2020 - Aug 2020\
Team lead creating a forecasting model for ATM utilization during the pandemic, reduced MAE from 8.6% to 6.3%

<b> Data Analyst Intern, Corning Incorporated </b> \
Corning, NY, May 2019 - Aug 2019\
Improved emerging trend identification by analyzing news data using topic modeling to track the rise and fall of industry trends

## Prior Research Projects

<b> Abstractive Dialogue Summarization </b> \
Creating an Issue-Resolution Summarization system for call center calls with the issue a customer is calling about and how the agent resolved a call\
Built a Bart-based summarizer fine-tuned on DialogSum & XSum datasets\
Employed methods to generate more faithful/truthful summaries such as training with a contrastive loss function and re-ranking beams by automatic faithfulness metrics 

<b> Title Generation</b> \
Research methods of extreme summarization to provide short descriptions for the purpose of extracting the main topic of a text\
Created topic summarization system using the following methodology
Used fine-tuned issue-resolution Bart to generate 3 summary beams for about 15k call transcripts \
Used Few-shot label generation with MPT-7B based off of Unlabeled Data Generation methodology to generate extreme summaries from the issue-resolution summaries\
Used transfer learning to train Bart to learn extreme summaries from original dialogue text.

<b> Semantic Role Labeling </b> \
Researching semantic role systems for dialogue systems to improve contextual understanding of low-resource systems \
Proposed new semantic role schema specifically for chatbots \
Demonstrated improved contextual understanding of chatbot when using the semantic role system to gain a better underlying understanding of language

<b>Machine Translation </b> \
Creating Spanish version of Erica by using automatic translation to create English version of utterances. Established novel financial Spanish-English translation dataset and nstituted a weak supervision loop to improve quality and quantity of training data
