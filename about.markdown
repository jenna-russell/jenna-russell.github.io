title: About Me
---

My name is Jenna, and I am originally from Rochester, NY and grew up enjoying all things outdoors. Rochester is the third snowiest city in the U.S, (yes, we get more than Alaska!) so I spent a lot of time skiing and love cold weather. After graduating from Cornell University, I made a big move to Dallas, Texas to start working as a Data Scientist for Bank of America. In my free time, you can find me at Spin Class almost every day, reading, or spending time with my cat Boo. In 2023 I read 81 books and love a good recommnedation! I also like trying new hobbies - in the last year I've learned to decorate cookies and embroider.
