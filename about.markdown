title: About Me
---

My name is Jenna! I am originally from Rochester, NY and grew up enjoying all things outdoors. I spent a lot of time skiing in the winter and love cold weather. After graduating from Cornell, I moved to Dallas to work as a data scientist for Bank of America. Now I'm happy to be back in the northeast for my PhD! In my free time, you can find me at the gym, cycling, reading, or spending time with my cat Boo. In 2023 I read 81 books and love a good recommendation! Add me on [goodreads][goodreads]! I also like trying new hobbies - in the last year I've learned to decorate cookies, embroider, and make my own ice creams.
